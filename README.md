# Shopping Mall Application
This is a simple shopping mall application built with Flutter. The app has only 2 pages, the first page displays products fetched from a dummy JSON API, and the second page is the cart page where users can see added products and can also remove them. The app uses the drift database for storing cart items into the local database, and the BloC pattern is used as the state management library.
